            Hawaii - Tropical 
            <br> <br> When people say and think Hawaii, they immediately picture the right vacation. Vibrant beaches, crystal water, palm trees, calming waves, sunbathing, snorkeling, and 
            other scenarios. The 50th American state provides diverse and various landscapes, such as volcanoes, mountains to hike on, and scenic waterfalls that provide unforgetable 
            sounds. The state's 6 islands has different kinds of activities and vibe for adventure and culture.

            Yosemite National Park - Nature
            <br> <br> Located in the golden state of California, Yosemite National Park offers giant, granite cliffs and wonderful waterfalls. Two must-see locations in this 
            park is Half Dome and El Capitan. As a year-round destination, Yosemite offers many different types of activities, but is more enjoyable during the summer.
            Visitors can go higher in elevation to catch some views of the park. Check before arriving, as some areas request permits.

            Italy - Rich Culture
            <br> <br> It is kind of obvious why Italy is one of the most-visited countries. The country has a lot to offer in terms of cities, such as Rome, Milan, Venice, Florence,
            and Naples. History is paved in each city, such as historical sites, art masterpieces, and of course its diverse food dishes. Check out the Colosseum
            in Rome or relax by the Canal Grande in Venice offering alleys and canals. Enjoy pizza and pasta in each region.
